	<h3>YUMA Annotation Server Overview</h3>
	<p>
	The YUMA Annotation Server is the storage back-end of the YUMA Universal 
	Media Annotation Framework. It can be deployed with a relational database
	such as <a href="http://postgres.org">PostgreSQL</a>, or a 
	<a href="http://mongodb.org">MongoDB</a> NoSQL database. The YUMA 
	Annotation Server provides the following services:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>JSON REST API</li>
		<li><!-- Indexing and -->Search</li>
		<li>OpenSearch API</li>
		<li>Linked Data interface (RDF/XML<!-- and N3 -->)</li>
		<li>RSS feeds - annotation feeds on objects and users, reply feeds
		on annotations</li>
		<!--  li>Statistics and reporting</li -->
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Setup &amp; Deployment</h3>
	<p>The YUMA Annotation Server is delivered as a Java Web application archive (.war) file.
	This file can be deployed in a Java Servlet container <!--   such as Tomcat 6, and an
	appropriate database backend (e.g. Postgres 8.3). Alternatively, YUMA Server can also
	be run with a MongoDB NoSQL database. Please note, however, that MongoDB support is experimental
	and available with limited functionality only at the moment. --> All configuration parameters
	are located in the web.xml file of the Web application. @TODO add
	instructions!</p>
