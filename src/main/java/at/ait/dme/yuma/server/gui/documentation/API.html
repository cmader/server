	<h3>API Endpoints</h3>
	<p>
	The API of this YUMA Annotation Server is available under the
	<strong wicket:id="api-base-url"></strong> root path. The API provides 
	basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations over a RESTful
	interface. 
	</p>
	
	<h4 wicket:id="api-annotation-base-url"></h4>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>HTTP POST</strong> to this URL will create an annotation. Supported payload 
		formats are JSON and (with limited functionality) RDF/XML. In case of success, the server
		will respond with HTTP 201 (Created) code, the URI of the annotation in the Location
		header, and the ID assigned to the annotation by the system in the response body.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 wicket:id="api-annotation-url"></h4>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>HTTP GET</strong> to this URL will retrieve the annotation with the specified
		ID. The server will respond with HTTP 200 (OK) and the serialized annotation in the payload.
		Supported response formats are JSON and RDF (XML or TURTLE). The format decision is based on
		the MIME type specified in the HTTP Accept header (content negotiation).</li>		
		
		<li><strong>HTTP PUT</strong> to this URL will update the annotation with the specified
		ID. If successful, the server will respond with HTTP 200 (OK), the URI of the 
		annotation in the Location header, and the (new) ID assigned to the annotation by the system 
		in the response body.</li> 
		
		<li><strong>HTTP DELETE</strong> to this URL will delete the annotation with the specified
		ID. The server will respond with HTTP 204 (No Content) in case of
		success.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 wicket:id="api-tree-url"></h4>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>HTTP GET</strong> to this URL will retrieve the entire tree of annotations that
		exist for an annotated multimedia object, specified by its (URL-encoded) URI. The server will
		respond with HTTP 200 (OK) and the serialized tree of annotations in the payload.
		Supported response formats are JSON and RDF (XML or TURTLE). The format decision is based on
		the MIME type specified in the HTTP Accept header (content negotiation).</li>
